# Invoice-Generator
This project is an automated invoice data extraction workflow built with n8n. It detects new PDFs in Google Drive, extracts and processes content using AI, structures key fields like invoice number and total, updates Google Sheets, and sends email notifications via Gmailâ€”saving time and reducing manual work.

Explaination of each node present in the project

1. Google Drive Trigger (fileCreated)
This node continuously monitors a chosen Google Drive folder.
How it works:
Whenever a new file (e.g., invoice PDF) is uploaded to the folder, this node triggers the workflow. It ensures automation begins the moment a file is added, eliminating the need for manual starts.

2. Download File (Google Drive)
This node retrieves the uploaded file so other nodes can process it.
How it works:
Uses the file ID provided by the trigger and downloads the full file (binary data).

3. Extract from File (PDF Extractor)
This node extracts raw text from the uploaded PDF.
How it works:
Reads the binary file and converts it into machine-readable text.

4. OpenAI Chat Model
This Sub node enhances and interprets the raw text extracted from the PDF.
How it works:
Sends the text to an OpenAI model.The model can clean up data, interpret context, and transform unstructured text into meaningful information.

5. Information Extractor
This node identifies and extracts specific details from the AI-processed text.
How it works:
It uses structured prompts or patterns to find key fields (Invoice Number, Customer Name, Email, Phone, Total Amount, Due Date) and outputs them as a clean JSON object.

6. Google Sheets (Append or Update Row)
This node saves extracted invoice details into a centralized Google Sheet.
How it works:
Either appends a new row for each invoice or updates existing rows if the invoice already exists.

7. Gmail (Send a Message)
This node notifies stakeholders once data has been extracted and saved.
How it works:
Creates a new email message.Inserts extracted invoice details or attaches the processed file.Sends it to a predefined email address.
